# üí´ About Me:
I am 30 years old and have been actively involved in the cryptocurrency space for the past 5 years. During this time, I have contributed to numerous significant projects, gaining valuable experience and expertise. To date, I have successfully set up and managed testnet node configurations for nearly 30 projects. My passion for testnets spans many years, and I have a deep enthusiasm for running nodes and engaging with test networks. I proudly identify as a full-time "Node Enthusiast."
Beyond the nodes I‚Äôve established, I have taken on additional responsibilities within these projects. I have served as both an Ambassador and a Moderator, representing and supporting the initiatives I‚Äôve been part of. I have actively participated in votes that influence the future development of these projects, ensuring my voice contributes to their direction. By connecting to technical support channels and voice chats, I‚Äôve engaged directly with teams and communities, offering insights and feedback. My involvement in decision-making processes has been further strengthened by providing actionable suggestions to project team members. Additionally, I‚Äôve supported global outreach efforts by providing translations and kept communities informed by commenting on relevant social media posts.
